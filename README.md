#Printing text in console with RustLang
To print text in your console, we will be using the ```println!``` function. For printing an Hello World text in the console with rust, we will be using the following code
```
fn main{
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
To run the following program, we will use the following commands in CMD to execute the Rust Program
```
>>> rustc filename.rs
>>> ./filename.exe
```
No matter what the OS is, the final output should be ```Hello World!```
